            Hey! This is a small webpage set up to hold several projects that I have been working on or finished entirely. I decided that
            I'd need to have some decent way of showing off the things I've finished over the years and deciding to set a webpage as a personal
            portfolio and get some experience in web design as a small project of mine which would be crushing two birds with one stone.
